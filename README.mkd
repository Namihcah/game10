# game10 - Tetris

My first game. Builded with C and some legacy OpenGL functions. Terrible stuff... But no OpenGL 3.x+ love with VirtualBox :(

For building this horrible sample you need a working C compiler, OpenGL libraries and the GLFW3 library. Only tried to compile this with the Fedora 20 and clang.

A C-tutorial that helped to create this (dbg.h, minunit.h and so on): [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/)
